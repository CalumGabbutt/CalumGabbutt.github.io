An extended talk covering the full breadth of our fluctuating methylation clock research, including their use to probe clonal dynamics in intestinal tissue (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-021-01109-w), and unpublished research extending this to multi-region samples using phylogenetic approaches and to assay the evolutionary history of blood cancers.
